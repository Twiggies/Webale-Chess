# How to execute

The classes/objects are mostly compiled, just open up CMD, change the directory to the folder and run the following command:

`java Game.java` 

## DOCUMENTATIONS NOTE:

After any edits, clear the contents of `Documentations` folder then run the following command:

`$   javadoc -author -d \Documentations *.java`



## What you need to do-

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your PC if you haven't already.
2. From git-bash or whatever preferred command line interface, `cd` to any place you want to put this project folder then run
`git clone https://github.com/FateGasm/AssignmentProject.git` 
3. Pull, commit, push. Rinse and repeat.

### Also to mention:

You can create folders inside repos. Most likely we'll just have one folder for the .png files and whatever misc stuff.
